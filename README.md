# **not-therapy**

Cheaper than a therapist, just as effective

Original idea by Eric Leigh

Development and implementation by yours truly

## **What?**
A simple web app to "listen" and "be interested" in your problems, just like a therapist!

## **Why?**
Are you unable to see a therapist? Do you not have the time, resources, or plain ol' self-respect to work on yourself? Are you American and your insurance doesn't cover mental health services? I care about as much as your Minimum Coverage Can't-Believe-This-Is-Legal PPO does, so why not try not-therapy?

## **How?**
not-therapy is a single-page application built with Vite React utilizing OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## **When?**
Right now

## **Where?**
Right here

## **Disclaimer**
not-therapy is not a suitable replacement for therapy of any kind. I am not a licensed therapist or qualified medical professional. 

I shouldn't have to include this in the readme, but maybe I do.
